<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Monday</h1><br/>ALL - New schedule. It's rather a suggestion of how students can schedule their day.<br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/125lz52VxtTbUyAF72limABsRMD9r2OrNrcDK5wkh6fY/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/125lz52VxtTbUyAF72limABsRMD9r2OrNrcDK5wkh6fY/edit</a><br />Yeah I'm not gonna use that. Seems like a lame schedule.<br /><br />History - Well crap looks like James Mick is doing a day 1/2 schedule. This week starts on day 2. IB World history will have assignments on tuesday and thursday.<br />Lang &amp; Lit - none<br />Spanish - New assignments (Due friday)<br />Algebra - Stuff for tuesday and thursday has been planned<br /><br />Comp Sci - none<br />TA PERIOD<br />TOK - All you need to do is finish the oral report (and pass) and have a passing class grade in order to finish TOK I. So this class might end up finishing itself early in the year. Looks like I can make a video for the presentation. <br />Physics - none</div></body></html>
