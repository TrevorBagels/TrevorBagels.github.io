<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">04/10</h1><br/><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Week one:  </span></strong><strong><br /><br />Title of work </strong><em><strong>Full Ethical Hacking Course - Network Penetration Testing for Beginners</strong></em><strong><br /><br />Arthur of work  </strong><em><strong>The Cyber Mentor (hosted on freeCodeCamp.org)</strong></em><strong><br /><br />What does this work have to do with ToK?  Be specific.  Think of this as a 20 min, in-class write. I am looking for about a page and specific links to ToK concepts and terms.<br /><br /></strong><em><strong>Summary of what I’ve learned</strong></em><em><br /></em>So far I’ve learned how to use an operating system that I’ve never used before, as well as tools that can be used to gather and collect information about a specific target, the legality of some of these tools, and what situations to use them in. I’ve also learned (about halfway through the course) that there were some pre-requisites to taking this course that I don’t meet, which has opened another path of content for me to teach myself.<em><br /></em><em><strong>What does this have to do with ToK?</strong></em><em><br /></em>At first, it’s fairly difficult to relate this directly to ToK, since ToK takes a more philosophical standpoint while the stuff that I’m learning holds a standpoint of practical/professional use. But I suppose I could go into some ToK stuff and relate it to the course. The easiest place to start would be ethics. When the title states the word <em>“Ethical”</em>, it's really refering to <em>“legal”</em>. The things learned in this course can be easily abused to do things illegal, or unethical, however, just because something is illegal, doesn't neccesarily make it unethical, does it?</div></body></html>
