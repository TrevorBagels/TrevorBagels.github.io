<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">27</h1><br/><strong>Trevor Hughes<br />Notebook #27<br />12/12/19<br />Making notecards - I created a virtual notecard system for this because I hate using paper. <br />The following is an output from my program that lists all of my saved notecards:</strong><br /><em>Select Action: showall</em><br /><em>Colonial Rule</em><br /><em>Big country rules over small country, and it's usually to establish settlements and exploit resources</em><br /><em>--------</em><br /><em>Indian Subcontinent</em><br /><em>Tis a term used for the area surrounded by the Indian Ocean</em><br /><em>--------</em><br /><em>Direct/Indirect rule</em><br /><em>Indirect - People elect people to make policies and govern stuff. Direct rule - people contribute to making policies themselves through majority rule</em><br /><em>--------</em><br /><em>1857-8 Indian Uprising</em><br /><em>An uprising, or rather rebellion, that happened in India of 1857, and it was apparently major yet unsuccessful.</em><br /><em>--------</em><br /><em>Britain</em><br /><em>A country that still believes in having a lifelong leader (who is the leader of Britain like the very moment they’re born I think)</em><br /><em>--------</em><br /><em>Sovereignty</em><br /><em>Supreme power, a self governing state.</em><br /><em>--------</em><br />Pick 5 words and connect them to India. Also, connect them to the origins of some independence movement.<br />1. Britain - They tried to colonize <strong>India</strong>  at some point, probably in the 1800s. <em>This led to India’s independence movement because everyone hates being ruled by the British and wants to get rid of them.</em><br /><br />2. 1857-8 Indian Uprising - A result of the British being jerks and trying to colonize <strong>India</strong>. <em>This can be considered part of India’s independence movement, since it involved an uprising and a rebellion.</em><br /><br />3. Sovereignty - As of modern day, <strong>India </strong>is a sovereignty, as in they rule themselves. <em>This is a result of India’s independence movement, if it weren’t for that movement, they’d still be under British rule and wouldn’t be a self controlling state.</em><br /><br />4. Indian Subcontinent - I have no clue how <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> to connect this to <strong>India</strong>, for it refers to the geographic location of <strong>India. </strong><em>This is the place where India’s independence movement probably happened. If this place didn’t exist, neither would India’s independence movement, and neither would India.</em><br /><br />5. Indirect/Direct Rule - When the British ruled <strong>India</strong>, the people living in <strong>India</strong> had indirect rule. When they finally won their freedom, they regained direct rule. <em>The people of India regained direct rule as a direct result of their independence movement.</em><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></body></html>
