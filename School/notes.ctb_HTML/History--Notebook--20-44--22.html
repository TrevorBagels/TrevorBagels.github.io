He had to call off the strike because police were being jerks<br />Mandela remains underground for 17 months to avoid arrest, and during this time he even received military training<br />Main idea – Mandela did stuff, he basically ran the ANC<br />1940s → ANC changed from a passive movement to something more serious or something<br />congress youth league was formed, they accused ANC of being elite and wanted the ANC to support the working class and stuff<br />CYL drew up the program of action – it called for civil disobedience<br />Other countries in the surrounding area had become decolonized<br />ANC called off defiance campaign after arrests and stuff<br />The defiance campaign turned the ANC into a mass movement, changed perceptions about ANC elitism and stuff, increased political awareness, membership increased from 7,000 → 100,000<br />Potato Boycott happened at some point. Potatoes.<br />PAC and ANC had anti pass things that lead to the Sharpeville massacre → led to some important change<br /><strong>PAC</strong><br />They were militant, not as large as the ANC, one strategy was to burn passes/await arrest, formed something called poqo?, they played a large role in the anti-pass campaign<br /><strong>ANC</strong><br />MK founded by the ANC + Congress Alliance<br />Nelson Mandela and some other dude something for the MK<br />the government infiltrated the MK<br /><strong>Albert Lutuhuli</strong><br />Played an active role in the defiance campaign<br />Elected as chief something something groutville?<br />Somethin about religion?<br />1952, elected as president of the ANC<br /><br /></div></body></html>
