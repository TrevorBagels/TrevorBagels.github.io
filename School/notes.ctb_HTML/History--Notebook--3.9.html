<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">3.9</h1><br/>Problems resulting from partition<br /><br />Partition → problems for india + pakistan<br />The partition was the most complex in Punjab (west) and Bengal (east)<br />These places had mixed populations, so they got divided between India/Pakistan<br /><img src="images\105-1.png" alt="images\105-1.png" /><br /><br />These borders were announced a few days after independence<br />That led to immense panic because hindus/muslims weren't all sorted out, so they found themselves on the wrong side of the border, and they struggled to flee and get to saftey.<br />This is what religion does to people. Discriminating someone because of religion is basically the same as racism. <br /><br />The Sikhs<br />They, as you already know, wanted their own state, but their demands were ignored. They feared the partition would leave their community powerless/split up<br />Border is officially announced, Sikhs and a bunch of Hindus head east from west punjab<br />A million people were killed in communal attacks (because religon causes violence)<br />Sikh Separatism<br />Sikhs == religous group (about 10 million)<br />    they have their own language, culture, identity, history, etc<br />Sikh political party == Akali Dal<br />They wanted more control for the Sikhs in Punjab<br />The Akali Dal held mass demonstrations (whatever that means) in 1955. As a result, the Indian Government had the army invade the Sikhs most “sacred” place (the Golden Temple in Amritsar) because they thought it would rid the Sikh protest.<br />Because the Sikh leader dude nearly killed himself fasting, in 1965, the Indian gov created a smaller Punjab state for the Sikhs. If you want something and can't get it, go to india and fast yourself to death and you'll recieve what you want from the government. Hmmm.<br />Punjab gets split into a new state called Haryana, as well as a smaller state called Punjab 2.0. (no, not actually punjab “2.0”, just punjab. again.)<br />For some reason, the position of the Sikhs remained unresolved, so in the 1980s, a campaign was launched by the Sikhs because they wanted a seperate Sikh state (didn't they already get one?) and this campaign got violent -- so violent they murdered the Indian prime minister (Indira Gandhi)<br /><br />The Bharatiya Jan Sangh (B(j)S)<br />The BJS was a Hindu nationalist party. They didn't like the secularness of the Indian state. Wow, I had no idea that the indian state was secular, I thought religion was a big part of their government. <br />Most of the BJS leaders were also members of a militaristic Hindu nationalist group known as the RSS. As you'd expect, the BJS promoted everything about religion, culture, and tradition. They used the following slogan:<br />“One country, one culture, one nation”<br />This doesn't seem like it's going to end well...<br />They were assholes to the Muslims (and probably every other non-hindu religion)<br />In the 1952 general election, the BJS won 3% of the vote. It's good to see everyone hates them.<br />According to some historian, Gandhi's (the original one) assassination messed up the credit of right-wing Hindu organizations, which messed up their political influence.  <br /><br />Later, the BJS is succeeded by the BJP (Bharatiya Janta Party) as the main hindu nationalist party. The promotion of hindu values and the creation of a state based on hindu crap became a thing in politics in the 1980s as support for the BJP grew.<br /><br />The movement was anti muslim, and it caused communal violence. In 1992 a mosque (muslim worship place) was destroyed because it was “built on one of the holiest Hindu sites”.<br />Wouldn't it just be great if people in power had no religion? It seriously would've solved all of this crap.<br />The creation of the muslim place led to (you guessed it) mORE vIoLeNcE between hindus and muslims (3000+ people died)<br />In the 1998 general election, the congress party got whamied by the BJP and the BJP started ruling india.<br />Then, in 2004, congress took down the BJP.<br />Oh, but in 2014, congress was taken down again by the BJP.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></body></html>
