Sounds familiar…</em><br />Whites also consolidated their power by hindering the black nationalist movement. They did this by <em>making it illegal for africans to have permanent residence in any urban centers, keeping them away from political activity, and making them live in reserves/lands owned by white settlers.</em><br />The great depression was an example of an external factor. The great depression impacted the whites positively as they got wealthier and it negatively impacted the blacks because they fell into famine, poverty (I think), and more famine. This impacted the black nationalist movement of Rhodesia because it took the spirit out of black nationalists. (When you’re fighting to survive, you don’t think of the other things that could be changed)<br />Other things: Their reserves were overstocked/overcrowded, they overfarmed → famine<br />WW2 was an example of an external factor. The white minority of Southern Rhodesia hoped for independence and help from outside sources, but was later concerned that people would want them to move towards colonization. When black soldiers returned from WW2, they found it impossible to go back to complying with things without question (they were treated better in war, which made them think about how things could be different). WW2 impacted the black nationalist movement of Rhodesia because it brought focus from other countries to the situation in Rhodesia.<br />The cold war was an example of an external factor. THe british needed the white minority of Southern Rhodesia to be an ally due to their fear of the perceived threat of the Soviet Union. However, the British also feared that the protest would turn into an armed resistance <em>(if majority loses control and minority gains control, they make a new gov, will it be communist or democratic?)</em>. Therefore, the Cold War impacted the black nationalist movement of Southern Rhodesia because ____.<br />To guarantee economic and political power, the white minorities of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia, and Nyasaland wanted to merge and create the Central African Federation (CAF)<br />The creation of the CAF was an example of an internal factor. Whites were in favor of the merger because it guaranteed them economic power, however, blacks were against the merger because it gave more power to the white minority. The CAF dissolved in 1963 because the protests intensified to the point of a potentially near rebellion. When the CAF dissolved, the other nations merged and they gained their independence with ___. This impacted the black nationalist movement of Rhodesia because ___.<br />The unilateral declaration if independence of 1965 was an example of a __ factor. The unilateral of independence was ___ by the international community. However, the British refused to use ___. United Nations and other countries placed economic sanctions which impacted Rhodesia, however ____. The establishment of Rhodesia as an independent colony ruled by minority had an impact on the black nationalist movement because _____.<br /><br /><br /></div></body></html>
