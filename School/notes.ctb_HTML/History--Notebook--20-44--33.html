<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">33</h1><br/><strong>Notebook #33<br />1/17/20<br />Also answer - to what extent did this factor lead to the growth of independence movements<br />Zimbabwe Factors</strong><br /><span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Universal</span> Unilateral Declaration of Independence - <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">All the declarations of independence there ever were? (probably not) </span>Gave those places in Rhodesia independence and stuff. Southern Rhodesia or zimbabwe or whatever remained under british rule (but they were kinda self governing) while others did not.<br />Great Depression - External, it happened in the US. It was a negative factor to the DOI. It caused famine and stuff (even in Zimbabwe), which made it harder to focus on getting independence.<br /><br /><br /><strong>India Factors</strong><br />INC (Indian National Congress) - Internal. They basically took over India when it was declared independent. <br />WW1 - External, some global conflict and stuff. As we know, the British love taxing people. Because of the war, the British started taxing the crap out of India, and it had a rather negative impact on the Indian economy.<br />WW2 - External, war. It was war. All over the place. It was global. People were mad. <br />Amistar Massacre - External, this one dude with a bunch of other dudes murdered a bunch of people in India while they were trapped in a plaza sort of place. LOts of death.<br />Great Depression - External. It crippled international trade, screwed up farmers, and more.<br />Muslim League - Internal, they proposed a partiition of India or whatever, and somehow this led to India’s independence<br />Constitutional Developments - This basically gave India some laws and stuff. This happened after the DOI. <br />Religion - If everyone had the same religion, there wouldn’t be conflict. I’m pretty sure there was religious conflict (internally) within India during the independence movement.<br /><br /><br /></div></body></html>
