This dude was one of the most important figures in British expansion into Southern Africa<br />Some elections were held in April of 1979, and a new prime minister took over the UANC (United African National Council) and changed the country’s name to Zimbabwe Rhodesia.<br /><br />Doing the reading -<br />P#1 - Lots of Africa had been colonized and then decolonized.<br />P#2 - Zimbabwe’s independence was rather peaceful.<br />P#3 - Zimbabwe represents African achievement<br />P#4 - Rhodesia was removed from the name because it’s linked to imperialism<br />1. Who was Cecil John Rhodes? </strong><em><strong>He was a British dude that had a major impact on British imperialism. </strong></em><em>Why was the British gov interested in the geographical region? </em><em><strong>They wanted gold and other resources. </strong></em><em>What was BSAC? </em><em><strong>The British South Africa Company, which was led by Cecil John Rhodes, and they exploited resources in Rhodesia. </strong></em><em>How did they control Zimbabwe? </em><em><strong>Force and diplomacy. Also taxes, labor, and land seizure.</strong></em><em><br /><br />2. Why did white settlers oppose BSAC rule? </em><em><strong>Because they didn’t like BSAC’s economic domination. </strong></em><em>What happened in 1923 to BSAC rule? </em><em><strong>The BSAC charter that was granted in 1889 expired, and Southern Rhodesia transformed into a self governing British colony. </strong></em><em><br /><br />3. According to the constitution of Southern Rhodesia, who could vote? A very small amount of Africans (0.00014%, which is one percent of ten percent of fourteen percent.), and the all the other people, obviously.  How much control did the British really have over Southern Rhodesia? Not much, since the country or colony or whatever had kind of started to take itself over.<br /><br />4. From what I remember, a bunch of land was taken away from people and given to other people. These lands were called ‘reserves’. Africans had to leave these places because they couldn’t occupy them without a pass/official document. <br /><br />5. The land that Africans were put into were arid and poor regions. The Great Depression caused black farmers to farm like it was their last time farming, and all this farming led to some ecological damage, and then from all this farming and ecological damage came some famine, which doesn’t make much sense, since farming should be the solution to famine but it isn’t. <br /><br />“Whatchya farming there?”</em><br /><em>“I’m famine famine.”</em> <br /><br /></div></body></html>
