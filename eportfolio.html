		<h4>Evidence #1 - Writing Excercise #1</h4>
		<div class='submission'>
			<div class='A'>
				<p>The term "carnivore" tends to be synonymous with "animal killer" in many peoples minds, but even worse, the term "omnivore" also tends to be synonymous with "animal killer" in the minds of vegetarians. Vegetarians see omnivorism as an engrained concept in society that results in the unnecessary deaths of animals. However, few omnivores choose to eat meat to support the deaths of their animal food-sources. On the contrary, many of these "animal killers" are just ordinary people living their ordinary lives, eating the food that gives them the nutrients they need to survive. For the truth is that there is an overwhelming number of reasons for including meat as part of one's diet. Perhaps the best reasons are to keep a balanced and nutritious diet, to save money, or to keep livestock populations under control. In this essay (that doesn't exist, nor will it ever), then, closely examining a vegetarian diet as opposed to a meat eater's died will show that omnivorism is clearly the better option for sustaining the nutritional health of this planet's inhabitants (not necessarily the planet itself.)</p>
				<p><i>I'd also like to point out that I could've done a better job with the "they say" part of this, like including the fact that vegetarians also see their methods as more sustainable, but for the purposes of mimicking the original paragraph as closely as possible, I put just about as much effort into recognizing the other side's viewpoints as the writer of the original paragraph did. </i></p>

				<p>For this writing exercise, we had to take a paragraph that argues for vegetarianism, and replace the topic (vegetarianism) with one of our own. My replacement topic of choice was a perfect fit for this paragraph.<p> <br><p>"Carnivorism."</p>

		<h4>Evidence #2 - Video Presentation</h4>

					We had to do a video-presentation about a topic relating to food. I chose water desalination, and I also chose to take the assignment very seriously, as you can clearly tell.
