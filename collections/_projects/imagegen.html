<h2>IMAGE GENERATION</h2>
<article>
	<p>I wrote an image generation program, which took several equations,
		 randomized them, and used them to generate color values based off of a pixel's position in the image. 
	Over 2,000 images were generated by my program, which I left running every night for a couple of weeks, 
	and the images here are all the ones that I found to be the best.
	<br>
	<i style='font-size: 70%;'>All images are owned by me (and were made by a program that I created) 
		and are under the Creative Commons license. 
		If you intend to use my creation for commercial use,
		please <a href="/connect">contact me</a> before doing so.</i>
