## Introduction 
### (for those who aren't too familiar with what I'm talking about)

Data. Another way of saying information. Some of it is wonderful, some of it is meaningless, but where does it come from? Well, thanks to the internet, data comes from just about everybody that uses the internet, whether they want to share it or not. Aside from being able to act as a system for shopping for physical products, all the internet really is, is a way for information to be exchanged between users. 

Without the internet, we wouldn't have such easy methods of sharing information, other than calling someone up on the phone, telling someone something in person, or doing something that's interesting enough to hit the news outlets.
With a network this basic, information doesn't go very far; it tends to stay between people that know eachother. 
But with the internet, the information goes everywhere. It goes to anyone that wants it, regardless if they know the people that the information belongs to. And with information capable travelling so far in such a short amount of time, as with any major technological advancement, people looking for money or power are going to get involved. And now we've got Google and Facebook, and tons of other companies that are making money because of this advancement. 

You'll notice that these companies don't offer many products that you spend money on, and that's because you're paying them simply by using their product. With the internet, a customer base is no longer dependent on how many stores you have across the world, because travel time isn't a problem. And now, pretty much anyone can start a business, and they can have billions of customers if their product or service is good enough. And the large user bases that corporations like Google and Facebook have become valuable to marketing firms. 

By automatically collecting your data, and analyzing it with something like artificial intelligence, advertisers no longer have the need to use mass advertising techniques, which is rather expensive. Instead, they use your data to determine what advertisments are best fit for you, and therefore more likely to succeed using these targeted advertisements than they are trying to advertise their product to everyone. And they'll pay money for this information, like, lots of money. 

## Becoming your own "data broker"

Aside from advertisers, data brokers (who buy your data then resell it to advertisers), can also build reports on individual people and sell them as background checks. Many companies use this when hiring somebody, and even government agencies use the data brokers when conducting investigations. 

That's cool and all (it really isn't, it's an invasion of privacy, as literally anyone with money can pay thirty bucks and find where you live, work, get details like your SSN, date of birth, etc), but why pay these data brokers if you can become one yourself?
For the typical person, it's too much of a hassle to try and set up a system to do that, and a typical person can't just pay Facebook and get all of their information. So really, if you try to do this, you aren't as powerful as an actual data broker. But it's still possible, it's just not as sophisticated. 

So, to start, where do you get the data? There's a few options here. 

### Scraping

Scraping is probably the most difficult way to collect data, but if done right, it can be pretty efficient. Scraping is, in simple terms, when you have an automated system that intreprets information from something like a webpage. It's a huge topic, and there are numerous ways of going about it, and again, it's difficult, and it becomes increasingly difficult as companies implement countermeasures to prevent automated scraping on their websites. 

### Data Breaches

Typically, breaching data is illegal (if you gained unauthorized access to the system, that constitutes as a federal crime in the US), however, once the breached data is published somewhere inconspicuous on the internet, it becomes public information. And having public information is *not* illegal. 
There are sites and forums where you can get these leaks for free, generally by participating in the forum discussions, earning credits, and then spending those credits to unlock download links to the data breaches/leaks. 
While I'm *somewhat* okay with all this sensitive data being available to the public, I'm not going to say where these places are, as raising awareness of where you can go to download this data would be a dangerous move for me. People on these sites don't like it when someone tells everyone about their site, and also, more awareness tends to lead to more abuse of this information.
