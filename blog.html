	Where things I write about go, because I might as well make everything I do and say publicly available to the internet, right?

	Oh, you're here early. I'm in the process of writing as many blog posts as I can in the span of a week, and then putting them here, saying that they've existed for much longer than they truly have. 
	Why? Because, I want it to look like I'm an experienced blogger, even though I'm not. Actually, I'm not a blogger, and I never will be. I'm just a person with a blog. Yeah.
	Those two articles down below might look like they've existed since the beginning of april, but I've been working on those since monday (a few days ago).
